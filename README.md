KANOPE is an Opera extension that creates a proxy for TOR
and protects you against some attacks like :
- Referrer & History sniffing
- User-Agent sniffing (if Javascript is disabled)
- Tracking by third party HTTP authentication headers.
- Some trackers (Google Analytics, AddThis, Omniture, Piwik etc...)
- Third-party cookies
Install the extension , follow our guide and then go to http://ip-check.info/ to see how much effective it is. <br>
It's not perfect but it's still much better than the default configuration.  <br>
(even if you manually disable cookies and Javascript) <br>
 <br>
It's my first extension for any browser so i apologize if it's not well coded. <br>
I made this extension because no addons on https://addons.opera.com/ filled my needs. <br>
See it as a all-in-one privacy package for Opera. <br>
 <br>
It can be modified to work with JonDo but you will have to make yourself. <br>
